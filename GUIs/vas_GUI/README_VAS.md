# vickrey_fee_GUI
Repository for the GUI involved in the VAS, value-landscape protocol

The goal of this script is:
1) To collect the user's desired exoskeleton torque magnitude from several options (0% to max torque magnitude) to command the mid-level controller
3) To display user's current ranking of the exoskeleton value on a number line

The GUI provides users with a number of options for a control setting (torque profile). 
Options range from 0Nm-40Nm in 2.5Nm increments
